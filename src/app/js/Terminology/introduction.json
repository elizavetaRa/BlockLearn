        "definition": `A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, linked together with cryptography (hashing functions) distributed in a peer to peer sharing network. This chain is a decentralized ledger which is synchronized and stored on each node (computer in the network) in a way that makes it practically impossible to modify the transactional data stored on the block. `

        "name": "Distributed Ledger Technology",
        "definition": `A blockchain is a ledger distributed in a peer to peer network. Often the term Distributed Ledger Technology and Blockchain are used interchangeably. This can be somewhat misleading since although a blockchain is always a distributed ledger, a distributed ledger doesn't always have to be stored on a chain such a blockchain.
        The Distributed Ledger is a ledger (database) shared and synchronized by consensus on each node (computer ) in a peer to peer network. However, the ledger doesn't need to consist of blocks and is therefore not always considered a 'Blockchain'.  `

        "name": "Immutability",
        "definition": `Blockchains uses a combination of cryptographic signatures, merkle chains and a transparent distributed peer to peer consensus system to make the record of transactions practically immutable. This creates a tamper free environment where one does no longer need to trust the record keeper.`

        "name": "Decentralization",
        "definition": `The decentralized nature of blockchains enabled by practically unhackable automated transactions means that one doesn't need to rely on decentralized middlemen. By creating trustful automated transactions one can create decentralized systems where middlemen, such as institutions, are not needed.  `
