        Anyone can download the code and start running a public node on their local device, validating transactions in the network, thus participating in the consensus process. In such blockchains anyone can send transactions and see valid transactions. The transactions are transparent but pseudonymised.
        It is this type of blockchain the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum platform is built upon and which is expected to disrupt the internet as we know it today.`

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to incorporate blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.`

        This means only selected individuals can access the blockchain. The consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes.
